# Preliminary Results

## Next Steps

We plan to continue development and analysis of robustness and accuracy metrics to further demonstrate the relevance of Koopman modeling of climate systems.
We will also investigate the inclusion of additional climate variables (top-of-atmosphere and surface heat fluxes).

Early summaries of causal models using the updated FKPM will come as well, allowing for further validation of the approach and the relevance of the produced models.
