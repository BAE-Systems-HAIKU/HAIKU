# Preliminary Results

We are initially investigating the simulation data from the CESM1  Large Ensemble Community Project (LENS) as well as observational satellite data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) from 1979 to 2020. All results shown here are based on a Fast Koopman Proxy Models (FKPM).

## Proof of Concept: Identifying Regions of Interest
Unlike most Machine Learning methodologies, the Koopman Operator Theoretical (KOT) framework learns a physically interpretable model. Applying Koopman Mode Decomposition (KMD) reveals underlying low-dimensional dynamics contained in the Koopman modes and eigenvalues. The Koopman modes associated with important eigenvalues can explain the spatial extent of the low-dimensional dynamics.

Training a FKPM on NSIDC sea ice concentrations (ICEFRAC) enables identification of spatial regions that experience rapid ice loss as seen in Figure 1. A region of interest is highlighted in the Barents and Kara seas as having a large components of rapid exponential sea ice loss.

We see that the extent of the mean and annual modes is qualitatively similar between  observational-based and CESM-based FKPMs. Additionally, the regions of high annual variance are highlighted as expected in the annual modes, while the regions of highest sea-ice concentration are highlighted in the mean modes. Next, we move to a more quantitative analysis looking at the accuracy of predictions generated by a FKPM trained from observational data.

To visualize the decadal trends of the data and our model, we looked at the September sea ice area over the last 40 years. Figure 3 shows that while the climatological mean is only able to capture the annual variation, our model is able to learn the long-term trend of the sea ice in addition to the annual variation.

The model is unaware of the dynamics of other causal climate variables that directly influence the sea ice concentration dynamics. Expanding the dictionary of observables used in the KOT framework by including additional climate variables will improve the modelling power of the HAIKU system.
