                <h1 id="preliminary-results">Preliminary Results</h1>
<p>We are initially investigating the simulation data from the CESM1  Large Ensemble Community Project (LENS) as well as observational satellite data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) from 1979 to 2020. All results shown here are based on a Fast Koopman Proxy Models (FKPM). </p>
<h2 id="proof-of-concept-identifying-regions-of-interest">Proof of Concept: Identifying Regions of Interest</h2>
<p>Unlike most Machine Learning methodologies, the Koopman Operator Theoretical (KOT) framework learns a physically interpretable model. Applying Koopman Mode Decomposition (KMD) reveals underlying low-dimensional dynamics contained in the Koopman modes and eigenvalues. The Koopman modes associated with important eigenvalues can explain the spatial extent of the low-dimensional dynamics.</p>
<p>Training a FKPM on NSIDC sea ice concentrations (ICEFRAC) enables identification of spatial regions that experience rapid ice loss as seen in Figure 1. A region of interest is highlighted in the Barents and Kara seas as having a large components of rapid exponential sea ice loss.</p>

</figure>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
We see that the extent of the mean and annual modes is qualitatively similar between  observational-based and CESM-based FKPMs. Additionally, the regions of high annual variance are highlighted as expected in the annual modes, while the regions of highest sea-ice concentration are highlighted in the mean modes. Next, we move to a more quantitative analysis looking at the accuracy of predictions generated by a FKPM trained from observational data.</p>
<p>To visualize the decadal trends of the data and our model, we looked at the September sea ice area over the last 40 years. Figure 3 shows that while the climatological mean is only able to capture the annual variation, our model is able to learn the long-term trend of the sea ice in addition to the annual variation. </p>

(Orange) Mean of CESM1 ensemble members’ predictions. (Green) Climatological mean of NSIDC observations. Each calendar month in the climatological mean is the mean of the data values of that calendar month over the entire training interval.  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p>The model is unaware of the dynamics of other causal climate variables that directly influence the sea ice concentration dynamics. Expanding the dictionary of observables used in the KOT framework by including additional climate variables will improve the modelling power of the HAIKU system.</p>
<h2 id="additional-climate-variables-as-observables">Additional Climate Variables as Observables</h2>
<p>We continue the development of the HAIKU system by including additional climate variables in the FKPM training. In particular, sea (potential) temperature, atmospheric temperature, and sea ice thickness were added. These generally improve the performance of the models and we plan to investigate the inclusion of additional variables (eg. solar irradiance and greenhouse gases).</p>
<p>We compare observational-based and CESM-based FKPMs trained on all climate variables. The mean modes are shown in Figure 4 and match expectation for the time average of these variables across the training interval.</p>

<figcaption align = "center" style="width:90%"><b>Figure 4:</b> The mean modes are visualized for the CESM-based FKPM (left) and the observational-based FKPM (right). The results are qualitatively similar and also match physical expectations for the time average of these variables.  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p>The annual modes are shown in Figure 5 and match expectation for the typical annual fluctuation of these variables across the training interval.</p>

</figure>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p>We have preliminary evidence that shows an improvement in modelling the sea ice concentration dynamics with the inclusion of these additional climate variables. We are interested in assessing the quality of the predictions generated from models with additional variables. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is computed between the monthly predictions of various models and the NSIDC monthly sea ice concentration data in Figure 6.</p>

<figcaption align = "center" style="width:90%"><b>Figure 6:</b> Four FKPM were trained with differing sets of climate variables (from observational data) and the pointwise RMSE of monthly Sea Ice concentration is shown (blue) compared to CESM1 data (orange) and the climatological mean (green). We see an accuracy gain when including ORAS5 Atmospheric Temperature (right), but not when including ERA5 Sea Surface Temperature (bottom) compared to Sea Ice Concentrations alone (top-left).   </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p>From this result, it is clear that the FKPM captures the dynamics more accurately with the inclusion of Atmospheric temperature. We speculate that the Sea Surface temperature has little positive impact we cannot obtain the sea surface temperatures in regions that contain sea ice. Including CESM simulated sea (potential) temperatures a few feet below the sea ice as an additional climate variable could improve the accuracy of these models. This will be a nice proof of concept for our Phase II approach to identify new measurements that could improve the accuracy of models built from observational data.</p>
<h2 id="inclusion-of-forcing-terms-in-the-model">Inclusion of forcing terms in the model</h2>
<p>Global Climate Models (GCMs) such as the Community Earth System Model (CESM) are driven by forcings such as greenhouse gases and other anthropogenic factors. 
We can apply the same forcings to our model to understand the impact of different scenarios on our climate systems. 
Figure 7 shows our model’s predictions under two different forcing scenarios: one with constant forcing after 2009, and one with historical forcing. 
Importantly, we find that the sea ice dynamics are mostly internally driven with little direct impact from the CO2 forcing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>We plan to continue development and analysis of robustness and accuracy metrics to further demonstrate the relevance of Koopman modeling of climate systems. 
We will also investigate the inclusion of additional climate variables (top-of-atmosphere and surface heat fluxes).   </p>
<p>Early summaries of causal models using the updated FKPM will come as well, allowing for further validation of the approach and the relevance of the produced models.</p>
