This approach makes use of Koopman Operator Theory. Koopman based models are able to represent complex dynamics with similar fidelity to much larger models with drastic improvements to speed while providing some intrinsic explainability. This approach enables analyses that allow us to identify causal relations between factors of interest in climate systems as well as to point to additional data or interventions that may mitigate undesired climate effects. Figure 1 summarizes the approach. Figure 1: HAIKU Architecture. HAIKU augments conventional climate models with the Hybrid Koopman Climate Model (HKCM) by learning previously umodeled dynamics of error between simulated data and measurements. The Fast Koopman Proxy Model (FKPM) is a learned fully Koopman based proxy model that enables causal analyses and experimentation by this speed-up. Finally, a graphical causal model allows users to visualize and interact with the FKPM and better understand the origin of tipping points and uncertainty in the model. Problem of Interest: Sea Ice Levels in the Arctic The recent decline in Arctic sea-ice coverage, thickness and volume has been dramatic, with the September sea-ice extent declining by about 40% during the past 40 years 0 and sea-ice volume by about 70% over the same time period 1 . Some projections indicate the Arctic climate system will approach the tipping point of an irreversible catastrophic ice-sheet disintegration, sea-level rise, and the disappearance of the perennial sea ice within this century. This tipping point primarily results from Arctic amplification which is believed to be driven by soaring anthropogenic forcing and associated positive feedback loops. Whereas conventional climate models enable impressive gains in understanding and forecasting, they suffer from several shortcomings. Most notably, these include complex physics that are difficult to represent, large computation requirements, and limited explanatory power for emergent behavior, such as tipping points. In the Arctic case, the global climate model (GCM) we propose to use, the Community Earth Science Model (CESM2), requires about 6 hours of a supercomputing cluster per simulated year. Moreover, conventional climate models have limitations with some examples being surface albedo 2 , sensitivity of ice loss to warming 3 , cloud fraction 4 , and cloud radiative forcing 5 . Focusing on one example \u2013 limitation of sensitivity to ice loss warming: with current models of sea ice concentration in the Arctic is that in data, we see a very strong coupling between ocean temperature and sea ice level. But the current climate models are only able to represent this coupling at a much weaker level and generally require much greater temperature increases than observed to generate the observed level of sea ice loss 3 . A model that is able to represent this observed coupling and explain what physics interactions are missed by the current models would be a boon to the field. Additionally, sea ice volume cannot be monitored continuously; it is a challenge to record these measurements in such a remote location. If we are able to assess the value of acquiring new measurements in specific locations at specific times that will have an outsized impact on generating accurate models and predictions, we may be able to improve current models and better quantify and mitigate catastrophic sea ice disintegration in the Arctic. More details about the Global Climate Model and associated data can be found in the Data and Climate Models section alongside the plans for their use in HAIKU. Koopman Modeling The Koopman evolution equation, \u03a8 (t+1) = K \u03a8 (t), is the closed-form climate dynamics equation we use. In a controlled climate system, we describe the evolution of climate states or observables as x (t+1)=F 1 ( x (t), u (t),\u03b8) where t is the time index, x is the climate model state vector, u , is the vector representing climate forcing, and \u03b8 is the vector representing strength of climate interactions. We apply a lifting function to go from the states or observables known to current climate models into a set of collective observables that the Koopman operator can operate on: \u03a8 (t+1)=A(\u03b8) \u03a8 (t)+B(\u03b8) u (t).

But from the programmatic level, we have two other components which should fall under this category as well, the Fast Koopman Proxy Model (FKPM) and our Analysis Toolkit. These work together leveraging a Koopman proxy model of the full climate system that can be trained and run in minutes instead of days. This enables our analysis toolkit and allows users to quickly test hypothesis and automatically determine uncertainty on forecasts as well as driving causal factors and potential interventions to avoid tipping points. Across both the HKCM and the FKPM, we will map from the inputs described in Section 3 into Koopman observables space and back. We will also specify the mapping between model parameters (or Koopman observables) and variables of interest described in the same section. By leveraging pregenerated data from the models of interest, we reduce the initial computational cost considerably, while hopefully maintaining sufficient diversity of model parameters to properly train the Koopman operators. Once we\u2019ve validated this approach, we will revisit running the full climate models with specific parameter values as necessary to explore potential tipping points and causal factors. The FKPM and mapping to factors of interest are required for us to present an understandable result and allow for expert interaction through the Analysis Toolkit, which consists of a semantic graph of those factors, an explainer that shows pathways that drive specific factors (like rapid sea ice loss), and an identification of which variables will reach a tipping point (along with further statistics of when, how, and why). More detail into Koopman Operator theory and how the various model components are constructed and serve the climate analyses of interest follow. Koopman Operator Theory Figure 1: Koopman models the dynamics of a reference system (1). Koopman transforms (2) the state space into an observable space and learns a linear operator (3) in the observable space. Various Koopman publications 1,2,3 contain more details. The Koopman Operator (Figure 1) represents the dynamics of a nonlinear, complex, and uncertain system with an infinite-dimensional space (called \u201cobservable space\u201d) that evolves under a linear operator. The lifting function that maps the system into observable space can incorporate prior knowledge, resulting in an abstracted, but understandable representation of the system. The Koopman operator-based compressed linear form enables extremely rapid simulations to explore numerous what-if scenarios and generate data for causal discovery of semantic causal factors. Moreover, specific eigenmodes of the system describe its long run behavior and can be used directly for tipping point analysis (see section 5.1.2). Compared to other data-driven approaches (e.g., neural networks), the Koopman operator extrapolates well. Even though it preserves complex non-linear dynamics, it is linear in observable space and is explainable because the operator can be expressed algebraically relating variables of interest, like ice cover. Additionally, the Koopman operator-based model learns on sparse data. The Koopman evolution equation, \u03a8 (t+1) = K \u03a8 (t), is the closed-form climate dynamics equation we use. In a controlled climate system, we describe the evolution of climate states or observables as x (t+1)=F 1 ( x (t), u (t),\u03b8) where t is the time index, x is the climate model state vector, u , is the vector representing climate forcing, and \u03b8 is the vector representing strength of climate interactions. We apply a lifting function to go from the states or observables known to current climate models into a set of collective observables on which the Koopman operator can act: \u03a8 (t+1)=A(\u03b8) \u03a8 (t)+B(\u03b8) u (t). Hybrid AI Koopman-Climate Model (HKCM) We plan to train a Koopman operator-based model to learn the dynamics of the difference between the predictions from current climate models and the actual measured records at each measured time step. This has the potential to identify physics that may be important to the quantification of tipping points or runaway sea-ice loss (Figure 2). Figure 2: Hybrid AI Koopman-Climate Model (HKCM)\u2014The Koopman Operator will predict the dynamics of the system given climate model output for the current step and the estimate of observables from the previous one. HKCM leverages modeled physics in the climate model while accounting for un-modeled physics. By placing the Koopman model in series with the Climate Model, it learns the dynamics of any missing physics and to account for any mismodeled physics. The details of which modes are excited in this Koopman model can be used to trace back to the original climate level variables and help identify which physics properties have been mismodeled. Our initial goal is to verify that the HKCM can learn the missing dynamics in sea ice concentration and to investigate the relevant modes to potentially determine the missing physics interactions in the climate model. Fast Koopman Proxy Model (FKPM) We will also train a full Koopman model to create a fast proxy model of the full climate simulation. This will enable a suite of analytics that can extract causality and better characterize tipping points and their associated uncertainty that would take months or years to do with the current best climate models alone. This is shown below (Figure 3).

Analysis of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues will help identify tipping points and regions of interest for deeper analysis.

But from the programmatic level, we have two other components which should fall under this category as well, the Fast Koopman Proxy Model (FKPM) and our Analysis Toolkit. These work together leveraging a Koopman proxy model of the full climate system that can be trained and run in minutes instead of days. This enables our analysis toolkit and allows users to quickly test hypothesis and automatically determine uncertainty on forecasts as well as driving causal factors and potential interventions to avoid tipping points. Across both the HKCM and the FKPM, we will map from the inputs described in Section 3 into Koopman observables space and back. We will also specify the mapping between model parameters (or Koopman observables) and variables of interest described in the same section. By leveraging pregenerated data from the models of interest, we reduce the initial computational cost considerably, while hopefully maintaining sufficient diversity of model parameters to properly train the Koopman operators. Once we\u2019ve validated this approach, we will revisit running the full climate models with specific parameter values as necessary to explore potential tipping points and causal factors. The FKPM and mapping to factors of interest are required for us to present an understandable result and allow for expert interaction through the Analysis Toolkit, which consists of a semantic graph of those factors, an explainer that shows pathways that drive specific factors (like rapid sea ice loss), and an identification of which variables will reach a tipping point (along with further statistics of when, how, and why). More detail into Koopman Operator theory and how the various model components are constructed and serve the climate analyses of interest follow.","title":"Koopman Assisted Climate Models"},{"location":"koopman/#koopman-operator-theory","text":"Figure 1: Koopman models the dynamics of a reference system (1). Koopman transforms (2) the state space into an observable space and learns a linear operator (3) in the observable space. Various Koopman publications 1,2,3 contain more details. The Koopman Operator (Figure 1) represents the dynamics of a nonlinear, complex, and uncertain system with an infinite-dimensional space (called \u201cobservable space\u201d) that evolves under a linear operator. The lifting function that maps the system into observable space can incorporate prior knowledge, resulting in an abstracted, but understandable representation of the system. The Koopman operator-based compressed linear form enables extremely rapid simulations to explore numerous what-if scenarios and generate data for causal discovery of semantic causal factors. Moreover, specific eigenmodes of the system describe its long run behavior and can be used directly for tipping point analysis (see section 5.1.2). Compared to other data-driven approaches (e.g., neural networks), the Koopman operator extrapolates well. Even though it preserves complex non-linear dynamics, it is linear in observable space and is explainable because the operator can be expressed algebraically relating variables of interest, like ice cover. Additionally, the Koopman operator-based model learns on sparse data. The Koopman evolution equation, \u03a8 (t+1) = K \u03a8 (t), is the closed-form climate dynamics equation we use. In a controlled climate system, we describe the evolution of climate states or observables as x (t+1)=F 1 ( x (t), u (t),\u03b8) where t is the time index, x is the climate model state vector, u , is the vector representing climate forcing, and \u03b8 is the vector representing strength of climate interactions. We apply a lifting function to go from the states or observables known to current climate models into a set of collective observables on which the Koopman operator can act: \u03a8 (t+1)=A(\u03b8) \u03a8 (t)+B(\u03b8) u (t).","title":"Koopman Operator Theory"},{"location":"koopman/#hybrid-ai-koopman-climate-model-hkcm","text":"We plan to train a Koopman operator-based model to learn the dynamics of the difference between the predictions from current climate models and the actual measured records at each measured time step.

The only difference between different ensemble members are perturbations (at round-off error magnitude) on the initial conditions.
